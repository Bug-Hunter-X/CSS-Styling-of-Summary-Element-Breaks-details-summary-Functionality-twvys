# Uncommon HTML Bug: details/summary Element Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to styling the HTML `details` and `summary` elements.  Styling the `summary` element to resemble a button can unexpectedly prevent it from correctly toggling the visibility of the `details` content.

## The Bug

The issue lies in applying CSS styles to the `summary` element, specifically when attempting to style it to appear and function like a button.  While the visual styling might seem correct, the underlying functionality of opening and closing the `details` section might be broken or inconsistent across different browsers.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe that while the `summary` element looks like a button, clicking it may not open or close the hidden content reliably.

## Solution

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.html`, involves ensuring that the `summary` element's default behavior is not unintentionally overridden by CSS styles. This commonly involves avoiding interfering with `cursor: pointer` and other default events related to the element.
